<h3 id="cs6501-understanding-and-securing-tls"><strong>cs6501: Understanding and Securing TLS</strong></h3>

<p>University of Virginia, Spring 2017</p>

<p><strong>Meetings:</strong> Fridays, 9:30AM - noon, Thornton Hall D115</p>

<p><strong>Course Objective.</strong> SSL/TLS is the world’s most important
  cryptographic protocol, used for every secure web connection and
  many other purposes. Every month it seems we hear about another new
  major vulnerability in TLS. In this project-focused seminar, we’ll
  take a deep dive into understanding how TLS came to be the mess it
  is today, look into some of the vulnerabilities in detail, and study
  methods for making TLS more secure. We will work as a group to
  contribute to open source projects to improve the security of TLS.</p>

<p><strong>Expected Background:</strong> Students are expected to enter the class with
  introductory background in cryptography (sufficient to understand
  symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems, cryptographic hash
  functions, and digital signatures) and experience in systems
  programming (comparable to a good undergraduate operating systems
  course).  If you do not have this background, you are still welcome
  to take the course, but will need to do some work on your own to be
  prepared before the semester begins (see the course site for links
  to recommended preparation materials).</p>

<h2 id="course-expectations">Course Expectations</h2>

<p>Students in the seminar are expected to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lead discussions on interesting topics during the class meetings.
For each week, there will be two groups of two students charged with
preparing a topic and leading the discussion.</p></li>

<li><p>Particpate actively in class meetings.  This means being prepared to
contribute by doing the assigned preparation (which will typically
involve reading a few research papers, but may involve other things
also) and thinking about the materials deeply to be able to
contribute well to discussions.</p></li>

<li><p>Produce scribe &ldquo;blogs&rdquo; for 2-3 topics.  For each topic, there will
be students assigned to write-up a blog about the topic to post on
the course site.  Students responsible for posting the blog summary
will be different from the ones charged with leading the topic
discussion, but should work closely with the leaders on the posted
write-up.</p></li>

<li><p>Work in a small team to conduct projects that will contribute
usefully to the TLS ecosystem. Projects may contribute to open
source implementations of TLS, provide resources for testing and
deploying TLS, analyze the state of TLS deployments today, or adress
other issues related to secure web connections.</p></li>

<li><p>Work with the class to produce a systematization of knowledge paper
on the security of TLS.  Everyone will be expected to contribute to
this, with the goal of jointly producing a publishable paper that
systematizes what is currently known about TLS and the ecosystem
around it.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="communications">Communications</h2>

<p><strong>Course Website:</strong>
  <a href="https://tlseminar.github.io/"><em>https://tlseminar.github.io/</em></a>.  All
  course materials will be posted on the course website, and students
  will be expected to provide materials to add to this site.</p>

<p><strong>Slack:</strong>
  <a href="https://tlseminar.slack.com"><em>https://tlseminar.slack.com</em></a>.  We
  will use a slack group for class communications.  You can join using
  any <code>@virginia.edu</code> email address.  You can also create slack
  channels for your team communications.</p>

<h2 id="honor-and-responsibility">Honor and Responsibility</h2>

<p>We believe strongly in the value of a <em>community of trust</em>, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strenghtening and
enhancing that community.  The course will be better for everyone if
everyone can assume everyone else is trustworthy. The course staff
starts with the assumption that all students at the university deserve
to be trusted.</p>

<p>In this course, we will be learning about and exploring some
vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=collab.virginia.edu&amp;latest">vunlerable
websites</a>.
<strong>You are trusted to behave responsibility and ethically.</strong> You may
not attack any website without permission of the site owners, and may
not use anything you learn in this class for evil.  If you have any
doubts about whether or not something you want to do is ethical and
legal, you should check with the course instructor before proceeding.</p>
