### **cs2102: Discrete Mathematics** (Section 1) 
### University of Virginia, Fall 2016

**Meetings:** Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:00-3:15pm in Chemistry 402.

**Course Objective.** The goal of this course is to students to
  understand, explain, and apply the foundational mathematical concepts
  at the core of computer science.  

The skills students learn in this course are essential for later courses
  (especially cs3102 and cs4102, but also in other courses), where they
  will be used to reason about and develop algorithms, prove properties
  about programs, and understand the limits of different models of
  computation.

**Expected Background:** The official prerequisite for this course is
  earning credit for CS 1110, 1111, 1112 or 1120 with a grade of C- or
  higher.  If you have not satisfied the official prerequisite, you need
  permission from the instructor to enroll in the class.

The particular background we assume is: 

- <em>Language:</em> reasonable proficiency in reading and writing English

- <em>Math:</em> understanding of whole numbers and addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, division and exponentiation.

- <em>Programming:</em> ability to understand and write simple programs
  in some programming language.  In some of the assignments in the
  class, students will be expected to read and write short programs in
  Python (so students who have not had previous experience with Python
  will need to learn a small subset of Python on their own).

- <em>Computing:</em> high-level understanding of how computers work.

**Materials:** The primary textbook is:

> Eric Lehman, F. Thomson Leighton, and Albert R. Meyer. [_Mathematics for
Computer Science_](../docs/mcs.pdf). (2016/6/16 version).  This book is
freely available on-line, and generously released under a [Create
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

The course will cover most of the first two parts of this book (Chapters
1-13), with some selected materials from later chapters.  In addition to
that textbook, we will have selected readings from other sources.

## Staff

**Teacher:** [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans) (evans@virginia.edu). My [office](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/office) is Rice 507.

**Assistant Teachers:** Adam Guo (BSCS 2018), Adam Rosenberg (MCS 2017), Anindya Prodhan (PhD Student), Brooke Dickie (Systems Engineering 2018), Christopher Long (BACS 2018), Harrison Nam (BSCS 2018), Hussain Humadi (CPE 2018), Jin Han (BSCS 2018), Luke Botti (BACS/Math 2017), Riya Simon (CPE 2019), Saikat Chakraborty (PhD Student), Sarah Barkley (BACS/Math 2018), Sihang Liu (PhD Student), Subhan Poudel (BSCS 2019), Yong Jae Kwon (BACS 2017)

**Office Hours:** _The course staff is here to help you._ Please donâ€™t
wait until too late to take advantage of the available help or ask for
help. For nearly everyone, this course will involve learning new ways of
thinking that are dramatically different from those to which you are
accustomed.  It is natural to miss things, and then become lost since
new ideas build on previous ones.  Come to office hours early to get
help before you find yourself frustrated and confused.

The office hours schedule is [posted on-line](officehours.md), and will
be kept updated throughout the semester.

## Communications

**Course Website:**
  [_https://uvacs2102.github.io/_](https://uvacs2102.github.io/).  All
  course materials will be posted on the course website.  This page is
  updated often and students are expected to visit it regularly. All
  lectures, notes and assignments for the course will be posted on the
  web site.  We encourage students to ask questions about the classes
  and assignments by posting comments on the course blog, and the course
  staff will read and respond to questions there.  

**Slack:** [_https://cs2102.slack.com_](https://cs2102.slack.com).  We
  will use a slack group for "real-time" communication for quick help
  and discussion (including during lectures).  Unlike the course site,
  which is public and visible to the world, this group will only be
  visible to people in the class.  There are slack apps for web, iOS and
  Android.

**Email:** Feel free to email me (_evans@virginia.edu_) with any
  personal questions or issues that should not be posted publicly. For
  general questions or issues that might be relevant for others in the
  class, it is better to post publicly to the course website or slack
  group (both so that others may be able to answer your question, and
  others may be able to see a response that will be useful to them). 

**Calendar:** The course calendar is available [as a Google
  calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=qqvq9kvd197mu6pib4p2uf79q4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York).
  Students are encouraged to incorporate this into your own calendar.  If you use Google Calendar, just click the "+" at the bottom right of the [calendar page](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=qqvq9kvd197mu6pib4p2\
uf79q4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York). If you use another calendar program, you can incorporate this calendar using [ical](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/qqvq9kvd197mu6pib4p2uf79q4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).

## Honor

We believe strongly in the value of a _community of trust_, and expect
all of the students in this class to contribute to strenghtening and
enhancing that community.  The course will be better for everyone if
everyone can assume everyone else is trustworthy. The course staff
starts with the assumption that all students at the university deserve
to be trusted.

To ensure that expectations are clear to everyone, all students are
required to sign the [course pledge](/pledge).

## Topics

The topics covered in cs2102 focus on developing the mathematical
foundation and skills that are most important for computer science.
Expected topics include:

- Propositions and Proofs
- Proof methods (including proof by construction, contradiction, and induction)
- Logic (Boolean, Logical Formula, 
- Binary Relations
- State machines
- Graphs
- Finite and infinite sets
- Number Theory

## Assignments and Exams

A detailed schedule is [maintained on the course website](schedule) and
[calendar](#calendar).

Key dates:

- Most Fridays (6:29pm): There will be a homework assignment due on
  Fridays, except for weeks when there are exams (and Thanksgiving
  week).
- Thursday, 6 October: Exam 1 (in class)
- Thursday, 10 November: Exam 2 (in class)
- Saturday, 10 December: Final Exam (9am-noon, scheduled by the registrar)

## Grading

Grading will be based on your performance on the exams and homework
assignments, with additional adjustments made based on exceptional
contributions to the class.

Grades will be calculated with several different weightings, where your
grade is based primarily on whichever weighting results in the highest
score.  The range of possible weightings is:

- Homeworks: 15-40%
- Exam 1: 10-25%
- Exam 2: 15-30%
- Final Exam: 20-50%
- Class Contribution: 0-25%
	      	 		
Spend your energy focusing on what you are learning, instead of worrying
about your grade.  Although the material we cover is challenging, and
the pace may seem overwhelming at times, I am confident that all
students who put effort into this class and take good advantage of
available help will do well.  Students who do especially outstanding
work in the course will be offered summer positions in [my research
group](http://www.jeffersonswheel.org).
