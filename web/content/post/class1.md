# Plan

1. Find your team, figure out a management structure, bid for T/L/S.

2. 

# Examining Certificates

1. When does the certificate for [https://whitehouse.gov](https://whitehouse.gov) expire?

2. (won't be able to answer this until later today) Does the new adminstration's [https://whitehouse.gov](https://whitehouse.gov) site use the same private key as Obama's?


# First Few Milliseconds

Jeff Moser's [_The First Few Milliseconds of an HTTPS Connection_](http://www.moserware.com/2009/06/first-few-milliseconds-of-https.html)

1. Install [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).

2. Start Wireshark, and look at all the TLS sessions running on your
laptop.  How many different TLS sessions are there? 

3. Pick one of the TLS sessions and try to figure out what application
is using it.  Who are the endpoints?

4. Assuming (for now!) the encryption is all perfect, what could someone intercepting?
