Here are some suggestions for getting the necessary background for the
seminar.  

## Cryptography

If you have already taken a cryptography course, you should have
enough cryptography background already.  If not, here are some
suggested ways to get enough crypo background over winter break to be
ready for the seminar.  I believe that for most students, the best way
to get the expected background for this course is to take my Applied
Cryptography course (more info below), but there are many options, and
lots of great resources that go into much more depth than my course if
you have more time.

### On-Line Courses

[**Udacity cs387: Applied
Cryptography**](https://www.udacity.com/course/applied-cryptography--cs387)
- this is an open on-line course that you can take anytime taught by
myself (so I am somewhat partial to it!).  There are [some additional
materials for the course
available](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/courses/cs387/),
including [extensive course notes
(PDF)](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/courses/crypto-notes.pdf)
created by Daniel Winter.  This is a very short and informal
introduction to cryptography, which would be enough background to be
prepared for the seminar.  (I can't give an unbiased assessment of the
course, but according to Information Week, it is a recommended course
to [_"Pump Up IT
Careers"_](http://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/team-building-and-staffing/5-online-classes-to-pump-up-it-careers/d/d-id/898915),
and [Prospect
Magazine](www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/online-universities-udacity-grand-challenge-david-stavens-dave-evans)
claimed the instructor has a "Monty Python humor" and "cult
following", although you shouldn't believe everything you read in
British magazines.)

Dan Boneh's [**Cryptography
Course**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) (offered through
Coursera).  The materials from previous courses are not available
(although you may be able to find them if you are resourceful), so you
have to take the course when it is offered by Coursera. There is a
session starting December 26.  This is an excellent course that is a
bit longer and goes into more depth on many topics than my course.
You can read [Bryan Pendleton's more objective
comparison](http://bryanpendleton.blogspot.com/2012/05/comparing-coursera-and-udacity.html).

Christoff Parr and Jan Pelzl's [**Understanding
Cryptography**](http://www.crypto-textbook.com/) textbook includes
Parr's excellent [video
lectures](http://wiki.crypto.rub.de/Buch/movies.php) (chalkboard
style without editing, so takes some patience to watch).

### Textbooks

[Crypto 101](https://www.crypto101.io/) - a very easy to read and
practically-focused introduction to cryptography (available as a [free,
creative-commons licensed PDF](/docs/Crypto101.pdf)).

[_Introduction to Modern
Cryptography_](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html), Jonathan Katz
and Yehuda Lindell.  This provides a lot more depth that is required
for joining the seminar, but is an excellent book for ambitious
students with more time.


## Computing Systems

Students in the class will benefit from understanding computing
systems and having experience with systems-level programming at least
at the level of a typical introductory operating systems course.
Students without this experience will either need to put a lot of
effort into learning it, or select projects and presentation topics
that focus on other aspects.

Some resources for learning about computing systems are below.

["Hack the Kernel"](https://www.ops-class.org/) - Operating Systems
class developed by [Geoffrey
Challen](https://www.bluegroup.systems/people/gwa/).  Provides
programming assignments you can try on your own, as well as video
lectures and lots of on-line materials.

[cs4414: Operating Systems](https://rust-class.org/) - Operating
systems course I taught in Fall 2013 and Spring 2014. Includes
[videos](http://rust-class.org/pages/classes.html) of lectures, and
programming assignments in Rust (some of which will need some updating
to work in the latest version of Rust).

CMU's [Computing Systems](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) course and
textbook by Randal Bryant and David O'Hallaron provides an excellent
introduction to systems programming, as well as a series of [fun
self-study labs](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html).

### Rust Programming

I'm hoping several of the projects will involve contribution to open
source projects using Rust to provide secure, efficient, and
iter-operable implementations of TLS and other cryptographic
functionalities.  It is not a requirement that you use Rust in this
class, but everyone will be encouraged to get some experience with it.

[**Rust Programming Language
Book**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/) (this is the
"official" Rust book, which includes a tutorial to get started)

[**Rust Tutorial**](http://aml3.github.io/RustTutorial/) (this was
developed for my [cs4414 class](https://rust-class.org/) by Alex
Lamana, Rob Michaels, and Wil Thomason.  (Some parts may need updating
to latest version of Rust, so if you go through this, please submit
updates as pull requests!)
